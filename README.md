# Uncontrollable
Now, I know people don't normally put short stories in their GitHub, but I needed somewhere to put it. 
## Here's the summary:
<br>
Arain, the protagonist, embarks on a perilous journey to destroy a hive that poses a new threat. Along the way, he’s forced to make physical and mental sacrifices, including the deaths of others. These sacrifices become infected with ethereal, corrupt energy, which begins to affect Arain himself, though he remains unaware of the corruption.

By the time Arain reaches the hive, his powers have become unstable, and the corruption has developed into a separate conscience. As his control weakens, the corruption takes over, but rather than succumbing to the hive mind, Arain merges with it, his consciousness lying dormant.

As the uncontrolled—those who have lost control of their powers—are hunted down and killed, the hive mind begins to weaken. This triggers an enraged Arain to emerge from his dormant state, with his powers purified and stronger than ever. In a final battle, combining physical and mental conflict, Arain overcomes the hive and finishes it once and for all.

This creates a layered narrative about power, sacrifice, corruption, and the inner battle for control, with Arain’s journey being both external and deeply personal.
